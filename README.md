# Next Word Prediction using Large Language Models(BERT, GPT and XLNet)

Using pre-trained large language models like BERT, GPT and XLNet we try to predict the next word. These models are then fine-tuned and then again the next word is predicted.

Overall, BERT had good performance compared to XLNet and GPT.
